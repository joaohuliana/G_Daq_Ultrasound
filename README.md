# G_Daq_Ultrasound
Software to control ultrasound imaging acquisition sequences using SonixDAQ with Sonix RP or Sonix OP systems.

# Overview

A graphical interface developed in C++ for controlling SonixDAQ hardware connected to a Sonix RP or Sonix OP ultrasound machine. This software enables acquisition of:

  Conventional ultrasound at frame rates up to 4000 Hz

  Photoacoustic (PA) images

  Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) images

The software provides direct access to hardware parameters including transmission (TX), reception (RX), and event sequencing for parallel ultrasound transducer data acquisition.
Key Features

High-Speed Imaging: Frame rates up to 4000 Hz for conventional ultrasound

Multi-Modal Support: Compatible with conventional ultrasound, photoacoustic, and plane wave imaging

Hardware Control: Direct parameter access for transmission and reception settings
